# My Svelte Template

A Svelte template purged of the standard template's monstrous defaults.

Specifically, this version has:
- Indentation with two spaces instead of tabs.
- Double-quoted strings.
- VSCode settings for auto-formatting on save.
- All tests in the `tests` directory, with Playwright tests in `tests/e2e` and Vitest tests in `tests/unit`.

This is a [Cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/2.5.0/) template; see there for usage instructions.
